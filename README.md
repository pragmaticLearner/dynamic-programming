# Dynamic Programming Repository

A repository to track my learning progress with Dynamic Programming to create optimal algorithms that are efficient for time complexity and memory storage.

The files will be problems found on the internet from sites such as 'codewars', 'hackerRank', 'leetCode' and any others while (googling) studying.

I've learnt and practiced mainly from YouTube and "Geeks for Geeks".

### How I approach DP 

Firstly I just try and problem solve as I normally would, which
is just the greedy algorithm and do as I go. 
I mainly google what I don't know or any bugs that come up in my program and solve by found method.

After this I then see where my code could be more efficient in my functions/algorithm. By substituting a line of code for a found function,
or by replacing any repetitive code that reduces time complexity or processing.

Break these problems into smaller problems and then find a solution that is optimal for the problem.

DP is for optimization and to reduce exponential time complexity to polynomial time
