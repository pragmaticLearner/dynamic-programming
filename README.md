# dynamic_programming

A repository to track my learning progress with dynamic programming to create algorithms that are more efficient for processing speed and memory optimization.

Feel free to add in anything you feel may be worth mentioning.

The files will be problems found on the internet from sites such as 'codewars', 'hackerRank', 'leetCode' and any others while studying.

I've learnt and practiced mainly from YouTube and codewars for dynamic programming
